# Design and UX

You canâ€™t code the front end and ignore design and user experience (UX). If you want to make your websites stop looking like they came from the 1990's, you'll need to gain an understanding for at least the best practices of design and User Experience (UX). This project, breaks apart the website for a popular design magazine [Here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ "Smashing Magazine"). The goal is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.
This project was completed for demonstration purposes in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
